# 📘 Machine Learning Study Journal

This repository contains my structured study of Machine Learning.

Each chapter includes:
- A dataset used for experimentation
- A model implementation
- A Jupyter Notebook documenting training, evaluation, and observations

This repo serves as a learning journal where I explore concepts chapter by chapter, implement models, and analyze their behavior in practice.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Build strong fundamentals in Machine Learning
- Connect theory with hands-on implementation
- Develop intuition for model behavior
- Document assignments and experiments
- Track my learning progress over time

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

For each chapter:

1. Study the underlying theory
2. Explore and preprocess the dataset
3. Implement or apply the model
4. Train and evaluate performance
5. Analyze results and limitations
6. Document insights and improvements
